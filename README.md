# evite-system
This is the Java code that I submitted for my final project in my Object-Oriented Programming course at USC. It simulates Evite.com, a website used for party invitations.
The program allows a user to enter Evite as a guest or host using log-in functionality - the user has to either sign in or create a new account upon entry, which will be added to a map of users. The user can view which parties they have been invited to, which parties they are hosting, and can create a party, with parties being of three types (subclasses): CasualParty, VisualParty, and CelebrationParty. Within these options are sub-features such as creating a what-to-bring list for a casual party, a gift list for a celeration party, and RSVP list for all types.
To install this project, please download the zip folder included and import it into the Eclipse program.
